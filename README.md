# OMNI-MIND

## Description

This web app uses OpenAI's legacy v1/completions API to respond to user prompts. It stores user prompts locally and enables the user to resubmit stored prompts. It is hosted [here](https://omni-mind.netlify.app/). The app was written using HTML, CSS/SASS, and vanilla JavaScript.

## Repository History and Rationale

I originally created this app in a very short time in order to submit it with an application to the 2022 Shopify internship competition, the challenge for which explicitly called for an app using the completions API. It is essentially unchanged since that time, except that I have included the API key safely now instead of just obfuscating it, and I have hardcoded the models available for v1/completions. 

Nothing about this app is impressive in itself (the core functionality is just a wrapper around an API call), so if you are here because you are looking for my personal projects in order to get a sense of my programming abilities, then please bear in mind that I created this after about four weeks of a web dev bootcamp. I hope it also gives you some sense of my personal taste and sense of humor.
